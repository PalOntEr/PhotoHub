# Image and Video Processing Application

This repository contains a C# desktop application that applies various filters to images, videos, or camera input using calls to a C++ DLL. The application utilizes the NVIDIA CUDA core library for parallel processing and displays the histogram of the current frame. It is built using WinForms for the user interface and Emgu for loading videos and accessing the camera.

## Prerequisites

- .NET Framework
- NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit
- Emgu CV
- C++ Compiler supporting C++11 or later

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-video-processing-app.git
    cd image-video-processing-app
    ```

2. **Build the C++ DLL**

    Ensure you have a C++ compiler and the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit installed. Navigate to the `PhotoHub` directory and run the bash command.
    After the command runs succesfully, move the `kernel.dll`, `kernel.exp` and `kernel.lib` files to the bin/debug or bin/release folder depending on your build settings

    ```bash
    nvcc -o kernel.dll --shared kernel.cu
    # Build instructions vary based on your development environment
    ```

4. **Set up the C# project**

    Open the solution file in Visual Studio and build the project. Ensure that the C++ DLL is accessible to the C# application.

5. **Install Emgu CV**

    You can install Emgu CV via NuGet Package Manager.

    ```bash
    Install-Package Emgu.CV
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application**

    Open the executable file generated by Visual Studio to start the application.

2. **Load media**

    Use the provided options to load an image, video, or access the camera.

3. **Apply filters**

    Select from the available filters to apply them to your media. Filters processed by the CPU or GPU will be applied as per the selected option.

4. **Real-time histogram and color detection**

    As you apply filters or view the camera input, the histogram will be displayed in real-time. For camera input, clicking anywhere on the frame will display the color information in the CIELAB color system.

## Technologies Used
